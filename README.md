###Analysis
####Approval Analysis
This spark file takes a deeper look into the comparison between the tweets 
and the approval ratings per president.  

For Obama we took a look at the average approval rating per year, compared to the 
average like count per tweet. We wanted to see if there was a correlation between the two.
